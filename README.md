# Outline

The  Employee  Management  System  stores  records  that  can  be  used  by  the  HRs  at  an 
organization where they can store the data of employees like their name EmpID, Email, Salary, 
and the number of complaints that were made against them using this they can check whether 
they are eligible for an appraisal or not.

Typical Features include:

Insert/Modify Employee Records – This system helps the HR to insert each employee record once and update it timely, and store it for further usages during appraisals, segregating employees based on their salary.

Delete Employee Records – This system enables options of deleting existing employee records, or miss entered employee records.

Eligibility View – As a part of the final consolidated view this system provides a view of employees where each employee’s eligibility criteria for appraisal is checked and displayed.

View Changes – We have an option to view each and every change done to each record from the time of insertion followed by any number of modifications done to the record.

Searching Employee record – Allows HR to search existing employee records by using the 
employee id that is used as a unique identifier.

# Description of Frameworks Used

JavaFX

JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich 
Internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended 
to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but both will be included for the 
foreseeable future. JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft 
Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Before  version  2.0  of  JavaFX,  developers  used  a  statically  typed,  declarative  language 
called JavaFX Script to build JavaFX applications. Because JavaFX Script was compiled 
to Java bytecode, programmers could also use Java code instead. JavaFX applications could 
run on any desktop that could run Java SE or on any mobile phone that could run Java ME.
On  desktops,  JavaFX  supports Windows  Vista, Windows  7, Windows  8, Windows 10, macOS and Linux operating  systems.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX  - cite_note- supportedOSes-7 Beginning  with  JavaFX  1.2, Oracle has  released  beta  versions 
for OpenSolaris.  On  mobile, JavaFX  Mobile 1.x  is  capable  of  running  on  multiple mobile operating systems, including Symbian OS, Windows Mobile, and proprietary real-time 
operating systems.
Version Used: JavaFX 8
